# noLedge
The idea of noLedge is to create an ai-assistant to have interesting dialogues with. 
I see it like: a voice to text input, a RAG-AI assistant with lots of cool documents, and a text to voice output (natural voice) 
The prompt for the ai agent shoul ressemble: be pedagogic, clear, and concise. 
The idea is to be able to iterate through ideas or concepts that are difficult to understand. 
A conversation can be an easy way to go up and down in knowledge abstraction, and a natural way for us to learn better. 

Imagine having all Plato's books on pdf fed to the AI assistant. Somehow, you can have a conversation with Plato himself ;)
